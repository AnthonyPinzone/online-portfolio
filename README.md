## Portfolio MVP

- [ ] Final Walkthrough
  - [ ] Spelling is correct throughout and grammar is on point
  - [ ] All links go where they're expected to go
  - [ ] All call to actions work as expected
  - [ ] All text is legible at all breakpoints
  - [ ] Passes all accessibility checks, shoot for AAA result, ok with AA for first pass
  - [ ] Do a speed test to see if anything obvious needs to be optimized

## Portfolio Future

- [ ] AAA accessibility compliance
- [ ] Dark Mode
- [ ] Theme Switcher w/ multiple color palettes
- [ ] Better animation for the experience timeline (GSAP? Framer?)
- [ ] Individual "pages" for the project pages instead of a modal (do some research here to see which is a better user experience first)
- [ ] Replace PropTypes with TypeScript
- [ ] Code Snippets feature w/ Storybook: _The goal here is to share commonly used code snippets for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and maybe other languages aimed at beginner devs. There'd be a tutorial aspect to this as well._
- [ ] Tutorial implementation: _This could be either an advanced feature of the Code Snippets storybook instance or a completely separate section of the site in more of a blog format._

## Other Ideas for Projects & Learning

_My biggest goal in my career is always to be learning or trying something new. Here are a few ideas for projects I have that would allow me to start expanding my knowledge into the Full Stack realm instead of solely Frontend focused._

- Project: Job application tracking tool
- Project: Full Time RVer Blog
- Project or Notion Page: Reusable RV checklist that's customizable
- Learning: Dig into Eleventy more, focusing on its usability for non-developers vs. Wordpress
