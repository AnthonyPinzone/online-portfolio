# Anthony Pinzone's Developer Portfolio

[Welcome to my Portfolio!](http://www.anthonypinzone.online)

I intend to keep on expanding this repository to include things like code snippets, tutorials, skeleton starters, and more!

Follow along on this sites journey via the checklist below, and if you're looking for an awesome Frontend Dev to contribute to or join your team, reach out via the contact form on my site ðŸ˜€

## Portfolio MVP

- [x] Choose a stack for the 2023 site update
- [x] Get a new branch started for the 2023 site update
- [x] Install the chosen stack on the new branch
- [x] Setup linting and tooling (ESLint, Prettier, SASS, etc)
- [x] Setup some basic SASS functions, mixins and variables
- [x] Get the homepage implemented with plain HTML/CSS
- [x] Continue tweaking the design until you're happy with the entire page
- [x] Break down the initial implementation into components
- [x] Make the navbar responsive
- [ ] Make the hero responsive
- [ ] Make the projects section responsive
- [ ] Make the experience section responsive
- [ ] Make the footer responsive
- [ ] Break large components down into smaller, more reusable components
- [ ] Update the `data.json` file to include as much real data as possible, replacing any lorem ipsum or stock images
- [x] Navigation links should smooth scroll to the appropriate section
  - [x] On mobile, close the panel first, then scroll
  - [x] Animations should be removed if `prefers-reduced-motion` is set to `reduce`
- [ ] View Project links should expand the chosen project into a modal like component with the following info:
  - [ ] Problem statement
  - [ ] Solution statement
  - [ ] Developer insights (define what this looks like)
  - [ ] Skills / Techologies / Languages used
  - [ ] HD imagery (if available)
- [ ] Setup horizontal scrolling in the experience section with CSS snapping functionality
- [ ] Remove the next and previous buttons for now, make each card tabbable for accessibility
- [ ] Add skills icons to the experience cards
  - [ ] Find icons for soft skills as part of this task
- [ ] Hook up all the footer navigation links
- [ ] Hook up the contact form to send an email
- [ ] Final Walkthrough
  - [ ] Spelling is correct throughout and grammar is on point
  - [ ] All links go where they're expected to go
  - [ ] All call to actions work as expected
  - [ ] All text is legible at all breakpoints
  - [ ] Passes all accessibility checks, shoot for AAA result, ok with AA for first pass
  - [ ] Do a speed test to see if anything obvious needs to be optimized

## Portfolio Future

- [ ] AAA accessibility compliance
- [ ] Dark Mode
- [ ] Theme Switcher w/ multiple color palettes
- [ ] Better animation for the experience timeline (GSAP? Framer?)
- [ ] Individual "pages" for the project pages instead of a modal (do some research here to see which is a better user experience first)
- [ ] Replace PropTypes with TypeScript
- [ ] Code Snippets feature w/ Storybook: _The goal here is to share commonly used code snippets for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and maybe other languages aimed at beginner devs. There'd be a tutorial aspect to this as well._
- [ ] Tutorial implementation: _This could be either an advanced feature of the Code Snippets storybook instance or a completely separate section of the site in more of a blog format._

## Other Ideas for Projects & Learning

_My biggest goal in my career is always to be learning or trying something new. Here are a few ideas for projects I have that would allow me to start expanding my knowledge into the Full Stack realm instead of solely Frontend focused._

- Project: Job application tracking tool
- Project: Full Time RVer Blog
- Project or Notion Page: Reusable RV checklist that's customizable
- Learning: Dig into Eleventy more, focusing on its usability for non-developers vs. Wordpress
